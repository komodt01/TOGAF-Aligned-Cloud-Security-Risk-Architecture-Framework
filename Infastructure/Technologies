# Technologies & Security Controls

## Identity & Access Management
- **Principles:** least privilege, scoped trust, short-lived credentials.
- **Practices:** role catalogs, permission baselines, approval workflows for privilege changes.

## Encryption & Key Management
- **At Rest:** managed KMS/Key Vault; CMKs for sensitive datasets.
- **In Transit:** TLS enforced; strong cipher policies; cert lifecycle tracked.

## Logging, Monitoring, and Detection
- **Collection:** CloudWatch, Log Analytics, SIEM aggregation.
- **Detection:** Rules mapped to **MITRE ATT&CK**; alert severity ties to risk thresholds.
- **Assurance:** Evidence retention, dashboards for KPIs.

## Vulnerability & Configuration Management
- **Scanning:** Inspector/Trivy/OpenVAS; IaC static checks; dependency/SBOM scans.
- **Prioritization:** **CVSS v3.1** with business context; SLAs per severity.
- **Remediation:** Runbooks; auto-fix for safe classes (e.g., public S3, weak S3 policies).

## Policy-as-Code & Governance
- **Enforcement:** AWS Config/Azure Policy; deny-by-default for logging & IAM break-glass.
- **Validation:** CI checks for Terraform/IaC; pull-request gates.
- **Governance:** Exceptions documented; periodic reviews; evidence for audits.

## Networking & Segmentation
- Private endpoints; ingress/egress controls; service-to-service authentication.
- Explicit zero-trust assumptions for east-west traffic.
