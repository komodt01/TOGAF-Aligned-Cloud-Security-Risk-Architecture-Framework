# Vulnerability Analysis – CVSS v3.1 Prioritization

This document defines how vulnerability findings are triaged and remediated based on **CVSS v3.1**.

## Severity Bands & SLAs
| CVSS Base Score | Severity | Target Remediation |
|-----------------|----------|--------------------|
| 9.0–10.0 | Critical | Immediate / out-of-band |
| 7.0–8.9  | High     | ≤ 7 days |
| 4.0–6.9  | Medium   | ≤ 30 days |
| 0.1–3.9  | Low      | Backlog / next maintenance window |

## Triage Factors (beyond CVSS)
- **Exploitability:** Known exploits, active campaigns.
- **Exposure:** Internet-exposed? Privileged component?
- **Compensating Controls:** WAF/IDS in place? Segmented?
- **Business Impact:** Affects regulated data? Critical service?

## Example Findings
| Vulnerability | Component | Example Vector | CVSS | Action |
|---------------|-----------|----------------|------|--------|
| OpenSSL Overflow (CVE-2023-0286) | Linux host | AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H | 9.8 | Patch immediately; confirm image rebuild |
| Log4j RCE (CVE-2021-44228) | Java runtime | AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H | 10.0 | Update library; SBOM check; regression tests |
| IAM Trust Misconfig | IAM | Misconfiguration | 7.2 | Restrict trust; add CI policy tests; alert on changes |

## Process Flow
1. Ingest scanner results (Inspector/Trivy/OpenVAS)  
2. Enrich with exploit intel; assign/remap CVSS if needed  
3. Create tickets with SLAs and owners  
4. Verify fixes; track evidence for audits  
5. Feed trends and gaps into **Phase H** (change management)
