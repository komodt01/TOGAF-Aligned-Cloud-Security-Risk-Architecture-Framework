# What is TOGAF (Plain-Language, Certification-Safe)

**TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework)** is a widely used **enterprise architecture** framework. It provides:
- A **common language** for business and technology stakeholders,
- The **Architecture Development Method (ADM)** lifecycle (A–H),
- **Architecture domains** (Business, Application, Data, Technology),
- Guidance for **governance** and **continuous improvement**.

> In this project, TOGAF is used **as a structuring model** to organize security architecture decisions. **No certification or compliance claim is made.**

## TOGAF ADM Phases (A–H)
| Phase | Purpose (as used here) |
|------|-------------------------|
| **A – Vision** | Define scope, drivers, risk appetite, and value |
| **B – Business Architecture** | Capabilities, roles, accountability, SLAs |
| **C – Information Systems** | Application & data relationships, identity boundaries |
| **D – Technology** | Platform controls: IAM, logging, scanning, encryption, network |
| **E – Opportunities & Solutions** | Options to improve coverage and efficiency |
| **F – Migration Planning** | Sequencing, dependencies, milestones |
| **G – Implementation Governance** | Conformance checks, policy-as-code, assurance |
| **H – Change Management** | Feedback from incidents/audits → architecture updates |

## Architecture Domains (Applied)
- **Business Architecture:** risk, compliance, outcomes
- **Application Architecture:** services, interfaces, trust relationships
- **Data Architecture:** flows, classification, observability
- **Technology Architecture:** platform controls and enablement

**Why use TOGAF here?** It enforces **traceability** from business context to technical decisions and ensures an **iterative lifecycle** instead of a one-time design.
