# Integration Overview – How TOGAF, NIST/ISO/CIS, MITRE, and CVSS Work Together

This project shows how to connect **business risk → architecture decisions → control selection → operational assurance** using a TOGAF-aligned structure.

## 1) TOGAF = Structure and Lifecycle
- Uses the **ADM (A–H)** to move from vision → definition → governance → continuous improvement.
- Encourages layered viewpoints (Business, Application, Data, Technology) so decisions are traceable across domains.

## 2) Security Frameworks = Control Baselines
- **NIST CSF** frames security functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover).
- **ISO 27001** anchors policy, governance, and management controls (Annex A).
- **CIS Controls** define concrete technical safeguards to harden platforms.

## 3) MITRE ATT&CK & CAPEC = Adversary Context
- Map relevant **ATT&CK techniques** (e.g., T1078, T1562.001) and **CAPEC patterns** (e.g., CAPEC-94 brute force) to ensure controls mitigate real attacker behaviors.

## 4) CVSS v3.1 = Risk Quantification
- Assign severity and priority to vulnerabilities to enable **risk-based remediation** tied to SLAs.

## 5) Closed-Loop Model
