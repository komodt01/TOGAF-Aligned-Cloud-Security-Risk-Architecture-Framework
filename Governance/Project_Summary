# Project Summary – TOGAF-Aligned Cloud Security Risk & Architecture Framework

## Phase A – Architecture Vision
**Objective:** Align cloud security with business risk tolerance and regulatory requirements using a repeatable architecture lifecycle.  
**Scope:** Multi-cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP); focus on identity boundaries, observability, vulnerability management, and governance.  
**Outcomes:** Risk-based prioritization, measurable assurance, continuous improvement.

## Phase B – Business Architecture
- **Drivers:** Regulatory obligations, availability/continuity goals, customer trust.
- **Risk Appetite:** Prioritize reduction of material risk; define SLAs for remediation.
- **Governance:** Assign accountability (security, platform, product) and escalation paths.

## Phase C – Information Systems Architecture
- **Identity Boundaries:** Define principals, roles, trust policies; minimize blast radius.
- **Service Interactions:** Catalog APIs, data producers/consumers, and call paths.
- **Observability Design:** Standardize logging, metrics, traces; centralize analysis.

## Phase D – Technology Architecture
- **IAM & Secrets:** Least privilege, scoped trust, rotation, brokered access.
- **Network & Encryption:** Segmentation, private endpoints, TLS in transit, KMS at rest.
- **Monitoring & Detection:** CloudWatch/Log Analytics + SIEM, rules mapped to ATT&CK.
- **Vulnerability Management:** Inspector/Trivy/OpenVAS → CVSS scoring → ticketing.

## Phase E – Opportunities & Solutions
- Policy-as-code for conformity checks and drift detection.
- Auto-remediation for high-confidence misconfigurations.
- SBOM and dependency checks integrated into pipelines.
- Cost/security telemetry surfaced as KPIs for leadership.

## Phase F – Migration Planning
1. Baseline identity, logging, and scanning enablement  
2. Control mapping to NIST/ISO/CIS and ATT&CK  
3. CVSS thresholds, SLAs, and runbooks  
4. Policy-as-code rollout and CI checks  
5. KPI reporting and governance cadence

## Phase G – Implementation Governance
- **Controls:** Measured against NIST/ISO/CIS requirements.  
- **Enforcement:** AWS Config/Azure Policy; exceptions tracked.  
- **Assurance:** Evidence retained; reviews tied to risk registers.

## Phase H – Architecture Change Management
- Feed incident findings, audits, and intel into backlog.
- Periodic review of ATT&CK coverage and detection gaps.
- Revisit risk appetite and SLAs as business context changes.
